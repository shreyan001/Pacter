# Backend Verification Results

## Test Results

✅ **Backend is working correctly!**

### What We Found:

1. **Storage Structure**: Contracts are stored in Redis under the `database` key with the correct structure from `backendformat.md`

2. **Available Contracts**:
   - `contract_1759914145829` - E-commerce Website Development
   - `contract_1759914169559` - E-commerce Website Development (with client signature)

3. **Contract Structure**: Both contracts have the complete structure including:
   - Parties (client & freelancer)
   - Signatures
   - Escrow details (INR and 0G amounts)
   - Project details
   - Milestones
   - Stage history
   - Jurisdiction info

### The Issue:

The contract ID you were trying to access (`contract_1759916816601`) **does not exist** in the database.

### Working URLs:

✅ http://localhost:3000/contract/contract_1759914145829
✅ http://localhost:3000/contract/contract_1759914169559

### API Endpoints Working:

- ✅ GET `/api/contracts` - Returns all contracts
- ✅ GET `/api/contracts?id=contract_1759914145829` - Returns specific contract
- ✅ POST `/api/contracts/[contractId]/sign` - Handles signatures

### Next Steps:

1. Use one of the existing contract IDs to test the contract page
2. Or create a new contract through the `/create` page
3. The contract page UI is ready and will work with any valid contract ID

### How to Get Valid Contract IDs:

1. Visit: http://localhost:3000/api/contracts
2. This will return all contracts with their IDs
3. Use any of those IDs to access the contract page
