# Prompt Leak Fix - Collection Status Not Showing to User

## üêõ **Problem**

When user said "I am a client", the AI was displaying raw collection status to the user:

```
Current collection status:
- projectName: ‚ùå Missing
- projectDescription: ‚ùå Missing
- clientName: ‚ùå Missing
- email: ‚ùå Missing
- walletAddress: ‚úÖ Collected
- paymentAmount: ‚ùå Missing
```

This looked like errors and was confusing/unprofessional.

## ‚úÖ **Root Cause**

The prompt template was including `{collection_status}` and `{collected_info}` which the AI was interpreting as instructions to display to the user.

## üîß **Fix Applied**

### **1. Made Collection Status Internal**

**Before:**
```
## Current Collection Status:
{collection_status}

## Previously Collected Information:
{collected_info}
```

**After:**
```
## Internal Collection Status (DO NOT SHOW TO USER):
{collection_status}

## Internal Previously Collected Information (DO NOT SHOW TO USER):
{collected_info}

**IMPORTANT**: The collection status and collected info above are for YOUR REFERENCE ONLY. 
DO NOT display this raw data to the user. Instead, acknowledge what they provided in a 
natural, conversational way.
```

### **2. Updated Response Format**

**Before:**
```
## Response Format:
1. If user provided new information: Acknowledge it specifically with ‚úÖ
2. Show current collection status (what's collected, what's missing)  ‚ùå BAD
3. Ask for the NEXT missing field with clear examples
```

**After:**
```
## Response Format:
1. If user provided new information: Acknowledge it specifically with ‚úÖ
2. **DO NOT show raw collection status or missing fields list**  ‚úÖ GOOD
3. Ask for the NEXT missing field in a natural, conversational way with examples
4. Be encouraging, professional, and friendly
5. Keep responses concise and focused on ONE question at a time
```

### **3. Added Better Examples**

**Added example for "I am a client":**
```
**Example 1 - User says "I am a client":**
User: "I am a client"
You: "Great! I'll help you set up a secure escrow for your project. I need to collect a few details:

Let's start with the project name. What would you like to call this project? 
(e.g., 'E-commerce Website', 'Mobile App Development')"
```

## üéØ **Expected Behavior Now**

### **User Input:** "I am a client"

**AI Response:**
```
Perfect! I'll help you create a secure escrow for your project.

Let's start with the project name. What would you like to call this project? 
(e.g., 'E-commerce Website', 'Mobile App Development')
```

‚úÖ Clean, professional, no raw status data
‚úÖ Natural conversation flow
‚úÖ Clear next step

## üß™ **Testing**

Test these scenarios:

1. **User:** "I am a client"
   - **Expected:** Clean response asking for project name
   - **Should NOT show:** Raw collection status

2. **User:** "Website Redesign"
   - **Expected:** "‚úÖ Project Name: Website Redesign. Now, describe what needs to be built?"
   - **Should NOT show:** Missing fields list

3. **User:** "I'm John, email john@example.com"
   - **Expected:** "‚úÖ Client Name: John ‚úÖ Email: john@example.com. What's the project name?"
   - **Should NOT show:** Collection status
