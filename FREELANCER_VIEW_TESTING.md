# Freelancer View Testing Guide

## Prerequisites

1. **Environment Variables** (add to `.env`):
```env
# Optional - for private GitHub repos
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_github_token_here

# Required - Agent wallet for verification
AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY=0x_your_agent_private_key

# Already configured
ZEROG_RPC_URL=https://evmrpc-testnet.0g.ai
NEXT_PUBLIC_PACTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourContractAddress
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

2. **Test Wallets**:
   - Client wallet (for deposit)
   - Freelancer wallet (for submission & withdrawal)
   - Agent wallet (for verification)

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Create Test Contract
```bash
# Start the app
npm run dev

# Navigate to /create
# Create a contract with:
# - Client: Your client wallet
# - Freelancer: Your freelancer wallet
# - Amount: â‚¹1,00,000 (0.1 0G)
```

### Step 2: Client Deposits Funds
```bash
# Connect with CLIENT wallet
# Navigate to contract page
# Click "Deposit 0.1 0G to Escrow"
# Confirm transaction
# Wait for confirmation
```

### Step 3: Freelancer Submits Work
```bash
# Disconnect client wallet
# Connect with FREELANCER wallet
# Refresh contract page

# In Freelancer Dashboard:
# 1. Enter GitHub URL: https://github.com/yourusername/test-repo
# 2. Enter Deployment URL (optional): https://test-app.vercel.app
# 3. Add comments: "Completed all requirements"
# 4. Click "Submit for Verification"
```

### Step 4: Verify Backend Updates
```bash
# Check backend logs
# Should see:
# - GitHub verification request
# - Repository data fetched
# - Metadata stored
# - Contract updated to "AI Verification"
```

### Step 5: Agent Verification (Automatic)
```bash
# Backend automatically calls verifyDeliverable()
# Using AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY
# Wait 10-30 seconds

# Frontend polls every 10 seconds
# Should see status change to "Awaiting Client Approval"
```

### Step 6: Client Approves Payment
```bash
# Connect with CLIENT wallet
# In Client Dashboard:
# - Review deliverable
# - Check GitHub repo
# - Click "Approve & Release Payment"
# - Confirm transaction
```

### Step 7: Freelancer Withdraws
```bash
# Connect with FREELANCER wallet
# In Freelancer Dashboard:
# - See "Payment Approved" message
# - Click "Withdraw 0.09 0G"
# - Confirm transaction
# - Wait for confirmation
# - See success message with tx link
```

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Happy Path
- âœ… Valid GitHub repo
- âœ… Accessible deployment
- âœ… Agent verification passes
- âœ… Client approves
- âœ… Freelancer withdraws

### Scenario 2: Invalid GitHub URL
```bash
# Enter: https://github.com/invalid/nonexistent
# Expected: Error "Repository not found or not accessible"
```

### Scenario 3: Private Repository (No Token)
```bash
# Enter: https://github.com/yourusername/private-repo
# Without GITHUB_TOKEN in .env
# Expected: Error "Repository not found or not accessible"
```

### Scenario 4: Network Error During Withdrawal
```bash
# Disconnect internet
# Click "Withdraw 0.09 0G"
# Expected: Error message with retry button
```

### Scenario 5: Wrong Wallet Connected
```bash
# Connect with CLIENT wallet
# Try to access Freelancer Dashboard
# Expected: "Connect with the freelancer wallet" message
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/contracts?id=YOUR_CONTRACT_ID | jq '.milestones[0].verification'
```

### Check Payment Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/contracts?id=YOUR_CONTRACT_ID | jq '.milestones[0].payment'
