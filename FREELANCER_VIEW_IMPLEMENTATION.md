# Freelancer View Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive freelancer dashboard with GitHub submission, AI verification, and payment withdrawal functionality.

## Components Implemented

### 1. FreelancerView Component (`src/components/contract/FreelancerView.tsx`)

**5-State Workflow:**

#### State 1: Ready to Submit
- GitHub repository URL input (required)
- Deployment URL input (optional)
- Additional comments textarea
- Submit button triggers verification flow
- Instructions for what happens next

#### State 2: Awaiting Verification
- Loading state with spinner
- Shows submitted GitHub URL
- Lists verification checks in progress:
  - Repository accessibility
  - Deployment connection
  - Code authenticity
  - 0G storage upload
- Auto-polls backend every 10 seconds for verification result

#### State 3: Awaiting Client Approval
- Success message: "Verification passed!"
- Explains work is under client review
- Shows what client can see:
  - GitHub repository
  - Live deployment
  - Verification proof
  - Comments

#### State 4: Ready to Withdraw
- Payment approved celebration message
- Shows payment amount (0.09 0G ≈ ₹90,000)
- Withdraw button triggers smart contract call
- Transaction confirmation flow
- Updates backend after successful withdrawal

#### State 5: Completed
- Success message with transaction link
- Links to block explorer for verification
- Contract marked as complete

### 2. Submit Deliverable API (`src/app/api/contracts/submit-deliverable/route.ts`)

**Verification Flow:**

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validates contractId, githubUrl, freelancerAddress
   - Verifies user is the contract freelancer

2. **GitHub Verification**
   - Parses GitHub URL (owner/repo)
   - Calls GitHub API to verify repository exists
   - Fetches latest commit information
   - Optionally verifies deployment URL is accessible

3. **0G Storage Integration**
   - Creates verification metadata object
   - Generates storage hash (simulated for now)
   - In production: uploads to 0G network

4. **Backend Update**
   - Updates milestone with submission data
   - Stores GitHub verification results
   - Updates contract stage to "AI Verification"

5. **Smart Contract Verification (Async)**
   - Calls `verifyDeliverable()` using AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY
   - Runs in background to avoid blocking response
   - Updates backend with verification result
   - Changes stage to "Client Review" on success

## Key Features

### Security
- Freelancer wallet address verification
- Only contract freelancer can submit
- GitHub token authentication (optional)
- Agent private key for contract calls

### User Experience
- Real-time status updates
- Auto-polling for verification results
- Clear error messages
- Transaction retry on failure
- Block explorer links

### Integration Points
- **GitHub API**: Repository verification
- **0G Storage**: Metadata storage (simulated)
- **Smart Contract**: `verifyDeliverable()` function
- **Backend**: Contract status updates

## Environment Variables Required

```env
# GitHub (optional - for private repos)
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token

# Agent wallet for verification
AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...

# 0G Network
ZEROG_RPC_URL=https://evmrpc-testnet.0g.ai
NEXT_PUBLIC_PACTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...

# Backend
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

## Testing Flow

### 1. Freelancer Submission
```bash
# Connect with freelancer wallet
# Navigate to contract page
# Enter GitHub URL: https://github.com/username/repo
# Enter deployment URL (optional): https://app.vercel.app
# Add comments (optional)
# Click "Submit for Verification"
```

### 2. Verification Process
- GitHub API checks repository
- Metadata stored on 0G
- Backend updated with submission
- Agent calls `verifyDeliverable()` on contract
- Frontend polls for verification result

### 3. Payment Withdrawal
```bash
# After client approves payment
# Click "Withdraw 0.09 0G"
# Confirm transaction in wallet
# Wait for confirmation
# View transaction on block explorer
```

## Smart Contract Integration

### Functions Used
```solidity
// Called by agent after verification
function verifyDeliverable(bytes32 orderHash) external onlyAgent

// Called by freelancer to withdraw
function withdrawFunds(bytes32 orderHash) external
```

### Transaction Flow
1. Client deposits → `createAndDepositOrder()`
2. Freelancer submits → Backend update
3. Agent verifies → `verifyDeliverable()`
4. Client approves → `approvePayment()`
5. Freelancer withdraws → `withdrawFunds()`

## Backend Schema Updates

### Milestone Structure
```typescript
{
  deliverable: {
    submitted: boolean
    submittedAt: string
    submissionLinks: string[]
    deploymentUrl: string | null
    comments: string | null
  },
  verification: {
    githubVerified: boolean
    githubVerifiedAt: string
    repoInfo: {
      owner: string
      repo: string
      description: string
      lastCommit: string
      commitMessage: string
      commitDate: string
    }
    storageHash: string
    agentVerified: boolean
    agentVerifiedAt: string
    verificationTransactionHash: string
    verificationError: string | null
  },
  payment: {
    approved: boolean
    approvedAt: string
    released: boolean
    releasedAt: string
    transactionHash: string
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### GitHub Verification Errors
- Invalid URL format
- Repository not found
- Private repository without token
- API rate limiting

### Smart Contract Errors
- Insufficient gas
- Transaction reverted
- Network issues
- Invalid order hash

### Backend Errors
- Contract not found
- Unauthorized access
- Update failures
- Network timeouts

## Next Steps

1. **Test Complete Flow**
   - Create test contract
   - Submit deliverable
   - Verify agent verification
   - Test withdrawal

2. **Enhance 0G Storage**
   - Implement actual file upload
   - Store repository snapshot
   - Generate IPFS-like hash

3. **Add Notifications**
   - Email on verification complete
   - Webhook for status changes
   - Push notifications

4. **Improve UI**
   - Add progress indicators
   - Show verification details
   - Display commit history
