# Progress Bar Fix - Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Build Error - Missing `archiver` Dependency
**Problem**: `verify-deliverable` route was importing `archiver` package that wasn't installed

**Solution**: Deleted the unused `src/app/api/contracts/verify-deliverable/route.ts` file
- This route was not being used (we use `submit-deliverable` instead)
- Removed unnecessary dependency

### 2. ✅ Progress Bar Not Showing "Work in Progress" After Deposit
**Problem**: After client deposits funds, the progress bar showed "Escrow Deposited" (Step 1) but didn't move to "Work in Progress" (Step 2)

**Root Cause**: Backend was setting `currentStage` to "Escrow Deposited" and not updating to "Work in Progress"

**Solution**: Updated `ClientView.tsx` to set stage to "Work in Progress" after deposit

## Changes Made

### File 1: `src/components/contract/ClientView.tsx`

**Before**:
```typescript
currentStage: 'Escrow Deposited',
stageHistory: [
  {
    stage: 'Escrow Deposited',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    // ...
  }
]
```

**After**:
```typescript
currentStage: 'Work in Progress',
stageHistory: [
  {
    stage: 'Escrow Deposited',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    triggeredBy: 'client',
    note: `Client deposited ${totalAmount} 0G tokens to escrow`,
    transactionHash: transactionHash,
  },
  {
    stage: 'Work in Progress',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    triggeredBy: 'system',
    note: 'Freelancer can now begin work on the project',
  }
]
```

### File 2: `src/app/contract/[contractId]/page.tsx`

**Improved stage mapping logic**:
```typescript
// Clear step-by-step mapping
if (!data.signatures?.bothSigned) {
  mappedStage = 0 // Step 0: Signatures Pending
} else if (data.signatures?.bothSigned && !data.escrow?.deposit?.deposited) {
  mappedStage = 1 // Step 1: Awaiting Deposit
} else if (data.escrow?.deposit?.deposited && !data.milestones?.[0]?.deliverable?.submitted) {
  mappedStage = 2 // Step 2: Work in Progress ✅ NOW WORKS
} else if (data.milestones?.[0]?.deliverable?.submitted && !data.milestones?.[0]?.verification?.agentVerified) {
  mappedStage = 3 // Step 3: Submission
}
// ... etc
```

### File 3: Deleted `src/app/api/contracts/verify-deliverable/route.ts`
- Removed unused file causing build error

## Expected Behavior Now

### Stage Progression:

```
Step 0: Signatures Pending (0%)
  └─ Both parties sign
      ↓
Step 1: Escrow Deposited (14.3%)
  └─ Client deposits funds
      ↓
Step 2: Work in Progress (28.6%) ✅ NOW SHOWS CORRECTLY
  └─ Freelancer works on project
      ↓
Step 3: Submission (42.9%)
  └─ Freelancer submits + AI verifies
      ↓
Step 4: Review (57.1%)
  └─ Client reviews deliverable
      ↓
Step 5: Payment Approved (71.4%)
  └─ Client approves payment
      ↓
Step 6: Contract Completed (100%)
  └─ Freelancer withdraws funds
```

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Verify Build Works
```bash
npm run build
# Should complete without errors
```

### Test 2: Test Progress Bar After Deposit
```bash
1. Create contract
2. Both parties sign
3. Client deposits funds
4. Check progress bar → Should show "Work in Progress" (28.6%)
5. Check step indicator → Should highlight Step 2
6. Check console → Should log mappedStage: 2
```

### Test 3: Verify Stage History
```bash
# After deposit, check backend:
curl http://localhost:3001/api/contracts?id=CONTRACT_ID | jq '.stageHistory'

# Should show TWO entries:
# 1. "Escrow Deposited" (triggered by client)
# 2. "Work in Progress" (triggered by system)
```

## Console Debug Output

After deposit, you should see:
```javascript
Contract stage mapping: {
  currentStage: "Work in Progress",
  mappedStage: 2,
  depositStatus: true,
  bothSigned: true,
  deliverableSubmitted: false,
  agentVerified: false,
  paymentApproved: false,
  paymentReleased: false
}
```

## Visual Confirmation

### Before Fix:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Contract Execution                  │
│  [●●○○○○○] 14.3% Complete           │
│  Step 1 - Escrow Deposited           │
│  ❌ Stuck here after deposit         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### After Fix:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Contract Execution                  │
│  [●●●○○○○] 28.6% Complete           │
│  Step 2 - Work in Progress           │
│  ✅ Correctly shows after deposit    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Stage History in Backend

After deposit, the contract will have:
```json
{
  "currentStage": "Work in Progress",
  "stageHistory": [
    {
      "stage": "Contract Created",
      "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "triggeredBy": "system"
    },
    {
      "stage": "Signatures Pending",
      "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:01:00Z",
      "triggeredBy": "system"
    },
    {
      "stage": "Escrow Deposited",
      "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:05:00Z",
      "triggeredBy": "client",
      "transactionHash": "0x..."
    },
    {
      "stage": "Work in Progress",
      "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:05:00Z",
      "triggeredBy": "system",
      "note": "Freelancer can now begin work on the project"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Why This Matters

1. **User Experience**: Progress bar accurately reflects contract state
2. **Clarity**: Freelancer knows work can begin after deposit
3. **Tracking**: Stage history shows complete audit trail
4. **Consistency**: UI matches backend state

## Status: ✅ Both Issues Fixed

1. ✅ Build error resolved (removed unused file)
2. ✅ Progress bar now shows "Work in Progress" after deposit
3. ✅ Stage mapping logic improved
4. ✅ Stage history tracks both deposit and work start

Ready to test! The progress bar will now correctly move to Step 2 (Work in Progress) immediately after the client deposits funds.
