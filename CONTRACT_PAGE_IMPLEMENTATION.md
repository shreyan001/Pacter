# Contract Page Implementation

## Overview
Implemented the contract viewing and execution page at `/contract/[contractId]` with a chat-based interface matching the create page design, featuring execution flow tracking and role-based views.

## Page Structure

The contract page follows the same design pattern as `/create`:
- **Left Panel**: ContractChat - Interactive chat interface showing contract details and actions
- **Right Panel**: ContractDiagram - Visual execution flow tracker
- **Footer**: Contract status and metadata

## Components Created

### 1. ContractChat.tsx
Main chat interface for contract interaction:
- Displays contract summary and details
- Shows signature collection interface
- Renders role-based views (Client/Freelancer)
- Collapsible full contract details
- Wallet connection prompts
- Matches CreateChat design pattern

### 2. ContractDiagram.tsx
Execution flow visualization:
- Shows 7 execution stages (Signatures â†’ Contract Closed)
- Progress bar with percentage
- Stage status indicators (completed/active/pending)
- Contract metadata (signatures, escrow status)
- Matches CreateDiagram design pattern

### 3. ContractDisplay.tsx
Compact contract details component:
- Parties information
- Financial details (INR and 0G)
- Project details and deliverables
- Jurisdiction information
- Optimized for chat interface display

### 4. ContractSignatures.tsx
EIP-712 signature collection:
- Shows signature status for both parties
- Collects freelancer information if missing
- Implements gasless typed data signing
- Submits to backend API
- Transitions to execution phase

### 5. ClientView.tsx
Placeholder for client actions:
- Deposit functionality
- Milestone approval
- Work review

### 6. FreelancerView.tsx
Placeholder for freelancer actions:
- Work submission
- Balance viewing
- Payment withdrawal

## Execution Flow Stages

1. **Signatures Pending** - Awaiting both party signatures
2. **Escrow Deposited** - Client deposits funds
3. **Work in Progress** - Freelancer working on deliverables
4. **Submission** - Work submitted for review
5. **Review** - Client reviewing submission
6. **Milestone Released** - Payment released
7. **Contract Closed** - Contract completed

## API Endpoint

### POST /api/contracts/[contractId]/sign
Handles signature submission:
- Validates wallet address matches role
- Updates contract signatures in Redis
- Collects freelancer info if provided
- Tracks events in stage history
- Transitions to "Awaiting Deposit" when both sign

## Design Features

- **Consistent UI**: Matches `/create` page design with slate/indigo gradient
- **Chat Interface**: Familiar chat-based interaction pattern
- **Visual Progress**: Real-time execution flow tracking
- **Role Detection**: Automatically detects user role from wallet
- **Responsive Layout**: Two-panel layout with proper spacing
- **Dark Theme**: Slate-800 background with blue accents

## Flow

1. **Load Contract**: Fetch from backend, determine current stage
2. **Show Interface**: Display chat + diagram panels
3. **Signature Phase**: Collect signatures if not complete
4. **Execution Phase**: Show role-based actions after signatures
5. **Track Progress**: Update diagram as contract progresses

## Next Steps

1. Implement ClientView functionality:
   - Deposit escrow funds to smart contract
   - Approve milestone completions
   - Review and approve submitted work
   
2. Implement FreelancerView functionality:
   - Submit deliverables with proof
   - View payment status and balances
   - Withdraw released payments

3. Add milestone management
4. Integrate smart contract operations
5. Add dispute resolution

## Technical Notes

- Uses wagmi for wallet operations
- EIP-712 for gasless signatures
- Redis for contract storage
- Matches CreateChat/CreateDiagram patterns
- TypeScript with proper typing
- Tailwind CSS for styling
