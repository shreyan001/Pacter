# Quick Test Guide - GitHub Verification

## Test 1: GitHub API (30 seconds)

```bash
node test-github-api.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
âœ… Repository verified successfully!
  Name: Pacter
  Owner: shreyan001
  URL: https://github.com/shreyan001/Pacter
  Homepage: https://pacter.vercel.app
  Latest commit: 17295f6

```

## Test 2: Verification API (1 minute)

```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```
Status: 404
Error: Contract not found

(This is correct - test contract doesn't exist)

## Test 3: Full UI Test (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Contract
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/create
2. Fill in contract details
3. Sign as both parties
4. Deposit escrow as client

### Step 2: Submit Deliverable
1. Open contract as freelancer
2. Enter:
   - GitHub: `https://github.com/shreyan001/Pacter`
   - Deployment: `https://pacter.vercel.app`
3. Click "Submit Deliverable"

### Step 3: Watch Progress
```
Step 1/5 âœ… Verifying GitHub Repository
Step 2/5 âœ… Downloading Repository  
Step 3/5 âœ… Uploading to 0G Storage

```

### Step 4: Verify Results

## Troubleshooting

### "fetch failed" error
âœ… FIXED - Now uses direct Redis access

### "Contract not found"
- Create a contract first in the UI
- Make sure you're using the correct contract ID

### "Unauthorized"
- Make sure you're connected as the freelancer wallet

### GitHub API rate limit
- Add GITHUB_TOKEN to .env for 5000 requests/hour
- Without token: 60 requests/hour
