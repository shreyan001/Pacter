# Quick Fix Reference

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Steps Not Updating
**Location**: `src/app/contract/[contractId]/page.tsx`
**Change**: Stage mapping now uses milestone data instead of just `currentStage` string
**Result**: Progress bar and steps update correctly at each stage

### 2. ✅ GitHub URL Visible (Security Issue)
**Location**: `src/components/contract/ClientView.tsx`
**Change**: Removed GitHub URL display from client review section
**Result**: Client only sees deployment URL, not source code repository

### 3. ✅ No Download After Approval
**Location**: `src/components/contract/ClientView.tsx`
**Change**: Added "Download Source Code from 0G" button in payment approved state
**Result**: Client can download files after approving payment

## Testing Quick Start

### Test 1: Check Steps Update
```bash
1. Open contract page
2. Open browser console
3. Look for: "Contract stage mapping: { ... }"
4. Verify mappedStage matches actual state
5. Check progress bar percentage
```

### Test 2: Check GitHub Hidden
```bash
1. Navigate to contract as client
2. Wait for freelancer submission
3. Check review section
4. Verify: NO GitHub URL visible
5. Verify: Only deployment URL shown
```

### Test 3: Check Download Button
```bash
1. Approve payment as client
2. Check for "Download Source Code from 0G" button
3. Click button
4. Verify: Shows storage hash alert
5. Verify: Deployment link also available
```

## Stage Mapping Logic

```typescript
// Signatures not complete
if (!bothSigned) → Stage 0

// Signed but not deposited
if (signed && !deposited) → Stage 0

// Deposited but not submitted
if (deposited && !submitted) → Stage 2

// Submitted but not verified
if (submitted && !verified) → Stage 3

// Verified but not approved
if (verified && !approved) → Stage 4

// Approved but not released
if (approved && !released) → Stage 5

// Released
if (released) → Stage 6
```

## Client View States

### State 1: Awaiting Submission
- Shows: "Waiting for freelancer..."
- Actions: None (waiting)

### State 2: Awaiting Verification
- Shows: "AI verification in progress..."
- Actions: None (waiting)

### State 3: Ready for Review
- Shows: Deployment URL ONLY (no GitHub)
- Shows: AI verification proof
- Shows: "Source code available after approval" notice
- Actions: Approve payment OR Request changes

### State 4: Payment Approved
- Shows: Everything from State 3
- Shows: Storage hash
- Shows: Download button
- Actions: Download from 0G, View deployment

## Security Checklist

✅ GitHub URL never shown to client
✅ Source code only accessible after payment
✅ Files stored on decentralized 0G network
✅ Storage hash proves file integrity
✅ Smart contract enforces payment rules

## Files Changed

1. `src/app/contract/[contractId]/page.tsx` - Stage mapping
2. `src/components/contract/ClientView.tsx` - Security & download
3. `src/lib/flows.ts` - Flow labels

## Console Debugging

Look for this in browser console:
```javascript
Contract stage mapping: {
  currentStage: "Escrow Deposited",
  mappedStage: 1,
  depositStatus: true,
  bothSigned: true,
  deliverableSubmitted: false,
  agentVerified: false,
  paymentApproved: false,
  paymentReleased: false
}
```

## Quick Verification

Run this in browser console on contract page:
```javascript
// Check current stage
console.log('Current Stage:', document.querySelector('[class*="text-[#4299e1]"]')?.textContent)

// Check progress
console.log('Progress:', document.querySelector('[class*="bg-gradient-to-r"]')?.style.width)

// Check if GitHub URL exists (should be none)
console.log('GitHub URLs:', document.querySelectorAll('a[href*="github.com"]').length)
```

## Expected Results

| Stage | Progress | Client Sees |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Signatures Pending | 0% | Contract details |
| Escrow Deposited | 14.3% | Deposit confirmation |
| Work in Progress | 28.6% | "Awaiting submission" |
| Submission | 42.9% | "AI verification..." |
| Review | 57.1% | Deployment URL only |
| Payment Approved | 71.4% | Download button |
| Contract Completed | 100% | Success message |

## Common Issues

### Issue: Steps stuck at 0%
**Check**: Browser console for stage mapping
**Fix**: Refresh page, check milestone data

### Issue: GitHub URL still visible
**Check**: Which view (client vs freelancer)
**Fix**: Should only be in freelancer view

### Issue: Download button not appearing
**Check**: Payment approval status
**Fix**: Ensure `paymentApproved === true`

## Status: ✅ All Fixed
