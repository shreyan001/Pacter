# Contract Page Final Fixes

## Changes Made

### 1. ContractChat Component
**Fixed Layout:**
- Separated scrollable contract details from fixed signatures section
- Contract details scroll independently in the main area
- Signatures section fixed at bottom (only shown when not both signed)
- Removed collapsible contract view - now always visible
- Better wallet connection prompts

**Structure:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Status Header (fixed)       │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│                             │
│ Contract Details            │
│ (scrollable)                │
│                             │
│ + Role-based Views          │
│   (after signatures)        │
│                             │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Signatures Section (fixed)  │
│ (hidden after both sign)    │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. ContractDisplay Component
**Enhanced Information Display:**
- ✅ Dark theme styling (slate-700/800 backgrounds)
- ✅ Contract header with ID and status
- ✅ Detailed parties information with locations
- ✅ Complete financial breakdown with fees
- ✅ Project details with timeline and deliverables
- ✅ Full jurisdiction and legal framework display
- ✅ Legal contract text in scrollable area
- ✅ Generation metadata (timestamp, generator)
- ✅ Proper icons for each section
- ✅ Color-coded party labels (blue for client, purple for freelancer)

### 3. ContractSignatures Component
**Dark Theme Styling:**
- ✅ Removed white Card backgrounds
- ✅ Applied slate-700/800 dark theme
- ✅ Compact signature status cards
- ✅ Freelancer info collection with dark inputs
- ✅ Color-coded sign buttons (blue for client, purple for freelancer)
- ✅ Better status badges with emerald for signed
- ✅ Proper spacing and font sizes

**Freelancer Detection Logic:**
- ✅ Detects if freelancer wallet is set
- ✅ If no freelancer set and wallet is not client → assumes freelancer
- ✅ Collects name and email from freelancer on first sign
- ✅ Validates info before allowing signature

### 4. Sign API Endpoint
**Fixed Backend Integration:**
- ✅ Uses Upstash Redis (RedisService)
- ✅ Fetches from `database` key (not individual keys)
- ✅ Updates contract in database array
- ✅ Handles freelancer info collection
- ✅ Updates wallet address when freelancer signs
- ✅ Proper stage transitions
- ✅ Stage history tracking
- ✅ Sets "Awaiting Deposit" when both sign

### 5. EIP-712 Signatures
**Gasless Signing:**
- ✅ Proper EIP-712 typed data structure
- ✅ Domain with contract address
- ✅ Message with contractId, hash, signer, role, timestamp
- ✅ Uses wagmi's `useSignTypedData` hook
- ✅ Submits signature to backend
- ✅ Refreshes page or triggers callback on success

## Wallet-Based View Logic

```typescript
const isClient = address === contract.parties.client.walletAddress
const isFreelancer = freelancerWalletSet 
  ? address === contract.parties.freelancer.walletAddress
  : !isClient && isConnected

// After both signatures:
if (bothSigned) {
  if (isClient) → Show ClientView
  if (isFreelancer) → Show FreelancerView
  if (!isClient && !isFreelancer) → Show "not a participant" message
}
```

## Flow

1. **User visits contract page**
2. **Connects wallet**
3. **System detects role:**
   - If wallet = client wallet → Client
   - If wallet = freelancer wallet → Freelancer
   - If no freelancer set & not client → Assume freelancer
   - Otherwise → Viewer (no actions)

4. **Signature Phase:**
   - Client signs → EIP-712 signature
   - Freelancer provides info (if needed) → Signs with EIP-712
   - Backend updates contract with signatures
   - Stage changes to "Awaiting Deposit" when both sign

5. **Execution Phase:**
   - Client sees ClientView (deposit, approve, review)
   - Freelancer sees FreelancerView (submit, withdraw)
   - Contract progresses through execution stages

## Testing

1. Visit existing contract: `http://localhost:3000/contract/contract_1759914145829`
2. Connect wallet
3. If you're the client → Sign as client
4. Connect different wallet
5. If you're not client → Provide freelancer info and sign
6. Both signatures → Views unlock
